# About the NCA-1008
NCA-1008: A computer in Scratch

The name "NCA" stands for "Nitro Compute Architecture" because it's fast. The 1008 is derived from the base it uses, and how many digits (yes, it uses base 10 instead of binary) are in a "chunk" (which is what NCA uses instead of bytes). (Yes, there will be more CPUs in the NCA family, for example, NCA-208, which would use binary).

NCA-1008's assembly code is designed to be as straightforward and powerful as it possibly can be within the boundaries of Scratch. I will make a guide for writing it soon.

There are a few accessible registers (A, B, C, D, W, X, Y & Z*) and some memory to work with. However, register Z is read-only in "PRG space" (which is my term for user-made programs) because there needs to a register or two to simply store a value from an operation.

The NCA-1008 is different because you it doesn't use the registers to accept input. Instead, your code is compiled from PRG into machine code which is interpreted. PRG which is where you write your programs. So in reality, it's more of an assembler with an integrated CPU.
